*How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?*  
Once feedback from end users has been gathered, the information can be organized by the Product Owner into user stories so scrum teams may understand customer needs.  Well-defined user stories allow the development team a chance to provide accurate feature additions that meet the needs of users.  

*How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?*  
In my previous efforts at developing programs, I have made products for myself using the waterfall model.  This has worked well for me knowing exactly what I need to complete tasks, but will not work as well when incorporating other people's ideas into projects.  The flexibility of the agile methodology allows teams to add to programs feature by feature to continuously roll out functioning software.  I hope to use this cyclical model along with feedback loops from end users to make successful projects that include more members than just me.  

*What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?*  
Being a good team member requires the ability to take criticism from others and adjust your workflow based on things that come up along the way.  Good team members also understand where their areas of expertise are and can help others gain the same understanding.  Passing along this valuable knowledge makes the team as a whole more efficient and independent.
